        <p> This semester, I moved into a new apartment downtown. I am excited about this move because it is closer to campus than my old apartment. It is also quiet, relaxing, and cozy. I really like how I have my new room set up and decorated in the new apartment as well. The best part of my room is my new bed, which is so comfortable that it is dangerous. I could lay in it all the time. What I am most excited about is living with my roommates, Carolyn and Regan. I have lived with Carolyn for four years now and just started living with Regn this year in the new place. We all get along really well and enjoy watching Game of Thrones together. </p>
