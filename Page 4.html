     <p> I am excited about most of the classes I am taking this semester. I feel like I am finally taking some higher classes that are interesting to me. These classes will also allow me to add skills to my resume. The classes that I am taking this semester are also much easier than the ones I was taking last semester. Last semester, I took a really hard class that took up most of my time. Hopefully this semester I will be able to have more free time to have fun as my classes are not as hard and this is the last year that I will be in college. </p>
